# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Layout

A Go workspace (`modules/go.work`, Go 1.26.0) containing four modules under `modules/`:

- `audit/src` — audit service exposing a gRPC API (proto: `modules/audit/src/route/grpc/audit.proto`), split into `cmd/api` and `cmd/worker` entry points
- `auth/src` — auth service (HTTP API only), backed by Postgres + Redis cache
- `queue/src` — queue service exposing a gRPC API (proto: `modules/queue/src/route/grpc/queue.proto`)
- `shared/src` — cross-service helpers: `utilhttp` (typed `AppError` + JSON request/response helpers), `utillog` (slog JSON logger), `utilcache` (Redis client + prefixed `Cache` wrapper), `utilgrpc` (gRPC `Dial` with functional options for client interceptors + an outbound logging interceptor; transport is plaintext only — mTLS is the mesh's job), and `utilotel` (`Init` for the global TracerProvider + MeterProvider, `HTTPMiddleware` for chi, `GRPCServerOption` / `GRPCClientOption` for the otelgrpc StatsHandler). Service-specific gRPC client wrappers do NOT live here — see the gRPC consumer pattern below.

Each service module follows the same internal layout: `cmd/<binary>/main.go` wires env → infra → service → route, while the layers live under `domain/` (entities, inputs), `service/` (business logic over `db.Querier`), `infra/database/` (sqlc + migrations), and `route/` (chi HTTP router for `auth`; gRPC `server.go` + `handler.go` + `interceptor/` for `audit` / `queue`). Cache access (Redis) is provided by `shared/utilcache` and consumed directly from `cmd/<binary>/main.go` — no per-service `infra/cache/` directory. Every binary calls `utilotel.Init(ctx, "<service-name>")` early in `run()` and flushes the returned shutdown ahead of DB / cache close so in-flight spans + metrics reach the Collector while the network is still up.

Service-to-service calls go over an internal Docker bridge network (`compose.yml`). When working on `audit`, `make audit` also brings up `queue-api` because the audit worker is expected to consume from it.

## Toolchain

The following tools are required and are pre-installed in the devcontainer (`.devcontainer/Dockerfile`):

- **sqlc** generates the `infra/database/db/` package from `migrations/*.sql` (schema) + `queries/*.sql` (queries). Regenerate with `make audit-sqlc-gen` / `make auth-sqlc-gen`. Do not edit files in `infra/database/db/` by hand — they are regenerated.
- **Atlas** runs migrations via the `migrator` container (see `.images/migrator/Dockerfile`). The `*-migrate` targets first run `migrate hash` (updates `atlas.sum`) and then `migrate apply` against the service DB.
- **golangci-lint** v2 config in `.golangci.yml`. Linters are grouped by intent: error handling (`errcheck` with `check-type-assertions` + `check-blank`, `errchkjson`, `nilerr`), resource handling (`bodyclose`, `rowserrcheck`, `sqlclosecheck`, `noctx`), exhaustiveness (`exhaustive` over `switch` + `map`), static analysis (`govet`, `staticcheck`, `unused`, `ineffassign`), and quality (`misspell` US, `gocritic`, `dupl`, `predeclared`, `nolintlint`, `gocheckcompilerdirectives`). Formatters: `gofmt` + `goimports`. `errcheck` / `errchkjson` / `dupl` are relaxed in `*_test.go` and `testutil/`; `noctx` is relaxed in `*_test.go`; `w.Write` is excluded globally. CI runs `make lint` and `make test` (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`).
- **kubectl + kind** for the local Kubernetes setup (see "Kubernetes deployment" below). The dev container shares the host Docker socket via `.devcontainer/compose.yaml`, so `kind` runs its node containers on the host's daemon.
- **istioctl** (pinned to `1.29.2` in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`) installs Istio Ambient via `make istio-up` (`istioctl install --set profile=ambient`). The control plane / ztunnel / Istio CNI manifests come from istioctl directly; only the small custom CRs (`PeerAuthentication`, `Gateway`) are checked into kustomize under `deploy/k8s/dev/` and per-service `gateway.yaml`. See `deploy/k8s/istio.md`.
- **protoc 28.3 + protoc-gen-go v1.34.2 + protoc-gen-go-grpc v1.5.1** generate the gRPC stubs (`*.pb.go`, `*_grpc.pb.go`) under each service's `route/grpc/`. Regenerate with `make queue-proto-gen` / `make audit-proto-gen`. Bumping versions also requires editing `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` and `Makefile`'s `PROTOC_INCLUDE`.

## Common Commands

All commands run from the repo root unless noted. The `MODS` variable in the `Makefile` is `auth audit queue shared` — module-wide targets iterate that list.

### Workspace-wide
- `make test` — runs `go test -v -coverprofile=...` per module and prints the `total:` coverage line; profiles + HTML reports land under `.coverage/<mod>-coverage.{txt,html}` at the repo root (single hidden directory, gitignored). `make clean-coverage` removes them.
- `make fmt` / `make vet` / `make lint` — per-module `go fmt`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint run`
- `make tidy` / `make update` — `go mod tidy` (and `go get -u ./...` for `update`) per module
- `make hooks` — installs git hooks at `.githooks/` (pre-commit: `fmt + vet + lint`; pre-push: `test`) and points `core.hooksPath` at it. Run after first checkout. `make hooks-uninstall` removes them.

### Running a single test
There is no make target for a single test. Run `go test` directly inside the module (each module is its own Go module):
```
cd modules/<service>/src && go test -run TestName ./path/to/pkg
```

### Per-service stack (Docker Compose)
- `make audit` ≡ `audit-build` + `audit-up` + `audit-migrate`. Brings up `audit-api`, `audit-worker`, `audit-db`, `queue-api`, `migrator`. `make audit-down` stops them.
- `make auth` ≡ `auth-build` + `auth-up` + `auth-migrate`. Brings up `auth-api`, `auth-db`, `migrator` (note: the auth API depends on the `auth_cache` Redis service in `compose.yml`, but `auth-up` does not start it — start it explicitly with `docker-compose up -d auth_cache` if running auth-api locally; v1 hyphenated `docker-compose` is what the Makefile uses everywhere).
- Postgres host ports: audit `5434` (avoids the very common host-:5432 collision), auth `5433`. Container internal port stays 5432 so service-to-service DNS is unaffected. Redis: `6379`. API containers expose `8080` internally.

### gRPC code generation
- `make queue-proto-gen` / `make audit-proto-gen` regenerate one service's `*.pb.go` + `*_grpc.pb.go` from the `.proto` next to them.

### Migrations
- New migration: `make audit-new-migrate` or `make auth-new-migrate` (NOT `make new-migrate MODULE=...`). These shell into the `migrator` container and call `atlas migrate new`.
- Apply: `make audit-migrate` / `make auth-migrate`.
- Migration files live at `modules/<service>/src/infra/database/migrations/`.

### Cleanup
- `make down` — stop & remove **every** container in this Compose project (services + obs stack). Named volumes preserved.
- `make nuke` — `make down` + drop named volumes (DB / Prometheus / Tempo / Loki / Grafana data). Use when host disk is tight and per-project state can go.
- `make rmi` — remove dangling Docker images
- `make rmv` — `docker volume prune`

### Observability stack (Docker Compose)
- `make obs-up` — start the OTel Collector + Prometheus + Tempo + Loki + Grafana stack (Compose `-f compose.yml -f otel/compose.yml`, opt-in — does NOT touch service stacks). Prints the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4317` line to export when re-running a service stack so telemetry actually flows. Grafana publishes to host `:3001` to avoid collisions with the typical dev-server `:3000`.
- `make obs-down` — stop & remove the obs containers (data volumes preserved).
- `make obs-logs` — tail otel-collector logs.
- `make obs-status` — `ps` of the five obs containers.

### Kubernetes (local kind)
- `make k8s-up` — full lifecycle: create kind cluster `dev` if missing → build all `:dev` images → `kind load docker-image` each → install Istio Ambient (`make istio-up`, which also installs the Gateway API CRDs before istiod) → `kubectl kustomize --load-restrictor=LoadRestrictionsNone deploy/k8s/dev | kubectl apply -f -` → wait for DBs/cache/migrate Jobs and the auto-provisioned auth gateway pod → print status and a smoke-test hint. Brings up the obs stack (collector / prom / tempo / loki / grafana) alongside the services. The `--load-restrictor=LoadRestrictionsNone` flag is required because the obs base kustomization references files outside its directory (`otel/k8s/base/` → `otel/<component>/*` via `configMapGenerator`).
- `make k8s-status` — pods/services/jobs across the `audit`, `auth`, `queue`, `observability`, `istio-system` namespaces.
- `make k8s-down` — delete the kustomization (cluster stays up). `make k8s-cluster-delete` removes the kind cluster entirely.
- Granular: `make k8s-cluster` / `k8s-build` / `k8s-load` / `k8s-apply`.

### Istio Ambient (local kind)
- `make istio-up` — `istioctl install --set profile=ambient -y` and wait for istiod / ztunnel / istio-cni rollouts. Called automatically by `make k8s-up`.
- `make istio-down` — `istioctl uninstall --purge -y` and delete `istio-system`.
- `make istio-status` — pods/services in `istio-system`.
- `make istio-port-forward` — canonical dev host-access path: `localhost:8081 → svc/auth-gateway-istio:80` via `kubectl port-forward`. NodePort + kind `extraPortMappings` was tried and abandoned (kindnet ↔ Istio CNI iptables interaction silently drops external NodePort traffic — see `deploy/k8s/istio.md` §3).

## Conventions Worth Knowing

- **Errors across HTTP**: services return typed errors from `shared/utilhttp` (e.g. `NewDBError`, `NewUnauthorizedError`). The route layer calls `utilhttp.ResponseError(w, err)` which type-switches on `AppError.Type` to the right HTTP status. Add new error categories by extending `ErrorType` and the switch in both `error.go` and `response.go`.
- **Request decoding**: `utilhttp.RequestBody[T]` and `RequestUrlParam[T]` require `T` to implement `Validate() error` (the `Validator` interface). New request types under `route/request/` must satisfy this.
- **Logging**: call `utillog.NewLogger()` once in `init()` to install a JSON `slog` handler at debug level, then use `slog` directly. Inside handlers and interceptors that have a request `context.Context` (HTTP / gRPC), prefer `slog.InfoContext(ctx, ...)` over `slog.Info(...)` — the call is one keystroke longer but lets a future log-export bridge auto-attach `trace_id` / `span_id` from the active span.
- **gRPC consumer pattern**: each consumer module that needs to call another service over gRPC owns a `<consumer>/src/infra/<svc>client/` wrapper (canonical example: `audit/src/infra/queueclient/`). The wrapper is the **only** place inside that consumer that may import `<producer>/route/grpc` cross-service — every other package in the consumer references producer types via the wrapper's type aliases. The wrapper also re-exports `utilgrpc.Option` so callers don't reach for `shared/utilgrpc` or `google.golang.org/grpc`. When proto adds a new message that the consumer must name, add a matching `type X = <svc>grpc.X` alias in the wrapper. See `coding-standards.md` §2 for the contract-surface exemption that makes the cross-service import legal.
- **gRPC error handling**: handlers return `status.Error(codes.X, msg)` from `google.golang.org/grpc/status` — `utilhttp.AppError` is HTTP-only and does not apply. The recovery interceptor (`route/interceptor/recovery.go`) converts panics to `codes.Internal` so the outer logging interceptor sees a meaningful code on the access log line.
- **Transport security**: app-level TLS is intentionally **not** exposed by `utilgrpc`. `Dial` uses `insecure.NewCredentials()`; mTLS between pods is the mesh's job (Istio Ambient ztunnel HBONE — see Service mesh section below). Don't reintroduce a `WithTLS`-style option without team agreement.
- **Generated code**: `infra/database/db/*.go` (sqlc output) and gRPC stubs under `modules/{audit,queue}/src/route/grpc/` (`*.pb.go`, `*_grpc.pb.go`) are generated — modify the source (`.sql` queries, `.proto`) and regenerate. The `shared/<svc>client/` wrappers are hand-written but follow a strict pattern: connection lifecycle + type aliases re-exporting proto types.

## Kubernetes deployment

Each service owns its k8s manifests under `modules/<svc>/deploy/k8s/{base,overlays/dev}/`. The cross-service entry point is `deploy/k8s/dev/kustomization.yaml`, which references each service's `overlays/dev` plus `otel/k8s/overlays/dev` (the obs stack) plus `peerauthentication.yaml` (the mesh CR — env-specific, lives in the same dir as the composer). Five namespaces (`audit`, `auth`, `queue`, `observability`, `istio-system`) are created — three per service module + obs stack + Istio control plane — and cross-service traffic uses `<svc-resource>.<ns>.svc.cluster.local` DNS (e.g. `queue-api.queue.svc.cluster.local:8080`, `otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4317`). Image names have no project prefix: `audit-api`, `audit-worker`, `auth-api`, `queue-api`, `migrator`, all tagged `:dev` for local kind. Upstream obs images (collector / prometheus / tempo / loki / grafana) are pinned to their published tags in `otel/k8s/base/`. `compose.yml` is preserved for Docker-Compose-based local dev — k8s is additive.

The obs stack is the one exception to the per-module manifest rule: it lives at `otel/k8s/{base,overlays/dev}/` (not `deploy/k8s/observability/`) because `otel/` also owns Compose, Collector configs, Grafana dashboards — k8s is one of several outputs and kustomize's `configMapGenerator` pulls `otel/<component>/*` config files into ConfigMaps. Istio's env-specific CRs (just `PeerAuthentication` today) live directly under `deploy/k8s/<env>/` because Istio has no env-agnostic kustomize manifests (the control plane comes from `istioctl install`); the `<component>/k8s/{base,overlays/<env>}/` shape would only nest empty layers. See `.claude/rules/kubernetes-conventions.md` for the binding manifest conventions and `deploy/k8s/README.md` for the full layout walkthrough.

## Service mesh (Istio Ambient)

`make k8s-up` brings up Istio Ambient between `k8s-load` and `k8s-apply`. The control plane (`istiod`), L4 data plane (`ztunnel`), and traffic-redirect plugin (`istio-cni-node`) live in `istio-system` and are installed via `istioctl install --set profile=ambient` — *not* kustomize. Only the small custom CRs are checked in: `PeerAuthentication` under `deploy/k8s/dev/` and per-service `Gateway` + `HTTPRoute` under `modules/<svc>/deploy/k8s/base/gateway.yaml` (today: auth only).

Each service namespace carries `istio.io/dataplane-mode: ambient` so ztunnel intercepts inter-pod traffic and wraps it in HBONE (mTLS) automatically — pods need no sidecar. Ingress uses Gateway API (`gatewayClassName: istio`); Istio auto-provisions an Envoy gateway pod + ClusterIP Service per Gateway resource. Host access in dev is via `make istio-port-forward` (NodePort + kind extraPortMappings was tried and abandoned — see `deploy/k8s/istio.md` §3). End-to-end: `make istio-port-forward` then `curl http://localhost:8081/health` reaches `auth-api`.

Default mTLS posture in dev is `PERMISSIVE` (mTLS coexists with plaintext). The flip to `STRICT` is one line in `deploy/k8s/<env>/peerauthentication.yaml` after verifying every caller is ambient-enrolled. See `deploy/k8s/istio.md` for the migration checklist, telemetry integration (Prometheus scrapes `istiod.istio-system:15014`), and uninstall steps.

Telemetry split: app emits L7 spans + RED via `utilotel`; Istio emits L4 (TCP bytes, mTLS handshake, control-plane health). No overlap — both feed the same Prometheus / Tempo backends.

## Observability

Telemetry is OpenTelemetry-native. Each binary calls `utilotel.Init` in `run()`, which sets up the global TracerProvider + MeterProvider from `OTEL_*` env vars and falls back to **noop providers** when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is unset — `make audit` / `make auth` stay zero-overhead in the default dev loop. HTTP services install `utilotel.HTTPMiddleware(...)` (its `SpanNameFormatter` reads `r.Pattern` so chi v5 / stdlib ServeMux 1.22+ both produce `"<METHOD> <pattern>"` span names automatically — no per-router retag middleware needed); gRPC servers add `utilotel.GRPCServerOption()` ahead of the existing `ChainUnaryInterceptor`; outbound clients (canonical example `audit/infra/queueclient`) prepend `utilotel.GRPCClientOption()` so trace context propagates cross-service.

The local dev stack at `otel/` ships across two paths: `make obs-up` (Compose include of `otel/compose.yml`) and `make k8s-up` (`otel/k8s/overlays/dev` brought in by the root kustomization). Both serve the same backends — `otel-collector` (contrib) → Prometheus (`:9090`) + Tempo (`:3200`) + Loki (`:3100`) → Grafana (Compose host `:3001` to dodge `:3000` dev-server collisions; in-cluster `:3000` Service) — with cross-signal correlation pre-provisioned and ConfigMaps generated from the same `otel/<component>/*` source files in both deployment paths.

Status of the four planned observability phases:

- **Phase 1 (traces + metrics):** done. Spans + RPC duration histograms reach Tempo and Prometheus; verified via `kubectl kustomize` and Compose smoke tests.
- **Phase 2 (rules + dashboards):** done. Recording / alert rules under `otel/prometheus/rules/`; three split dashboards (`go-runtime`, `http-red`, `grpc-red`).
- **Phase 3 (logs producer):** **paused.** The `otelslog` bridge crashed `audit-api` with a SIGSEGV inside `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log` v0.19's `sync.Pool` path under Go 1.26.2. The bridge is reverted; logs flow only to stdout via `utillog`. Loki container, Collector logs pipeline, and Grafana datasource remain provisioned and idle so re-enabling is one Init function edit away when sdk/log ships a fix (or we pivot to a `filelog` receiver). The `slog.InfoContext` switch in interceptors stays — ctx-aware logging is good practice on its own and is exactly what a future bridge will use.
- **Phase 4 (k8s overlay):** done. Five Deployments + Services in `observability` namespace; service-side `OTEL_*` env in each module's k8s ConfigMap points at `otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4317`.

See `otel/README.md` for the architecture diagram, port table, troubleshooting, and how to add a custom metric / span.

## Per-module guidance

Each service module also ships its own `modules/<svc>/CLAUDE.md` with module-local invariants (canonical reading order, what's stub vs. real, module-specific Make targets, gotchas). Read it first when working inside a single service — it picks up where this file leaves off.

## Per-service design docs

Each service has an MVP-level system design doc that future changes should align with. Read the relevant one before non-trivial work in that module:

- `modules/auth/docs/system-design.md` — OAuth 2.0 / OIDC AS
- `modules/audit/docs/system-design.md` — 5W1H audit trail
- `modules/queue/docs/system-design.md` — priority queue + audit contract
